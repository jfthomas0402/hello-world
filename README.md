# hello-world

Greetings!  I got tired on dependencies and decided I could stand to pick up some hard skills.  
The idea is that I can be a better product manager and I can be a more independent researcher by having some coding skills.  
I've tried many times to pick up coding on the side.  But, my day job has always overcome my ability to do self-driven projects.
In 2019, I committed to changing career tracks and haven't looked back since.
